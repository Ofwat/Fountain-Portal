# Fountain Portal

This is a sample Grails application as a demonstration dfor methods of data capture form a third party into the Fountain application. 

This is an 'activator' in that it contains no business logic just UI and feature ideas to prompt discussion. 

To build the project and run tests see the [Grails documentation](http://docs.grails.org/2.5.4/)
